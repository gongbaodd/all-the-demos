```js
// This is a JavaScript Quiz from BFE.dev

function a(){
}
const b = function() {

}

const c = function d() {
  console.log(typeof d) // function
  d = 'e'
  console.log(typeof d) // function
}

console.log(typeof a) // function
console.log(typeof b) // function
console.log(typeof c) // function
console.log(typeof d) // undefined
c()
```

The special case is inside the named function d. The function name is un-reassignable inside the function. You can easily see the difference if you run this in "use strict" mode where it gives an error Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. Thus, d will still point to the named function d despite being reassigned to "e"

Note that, the result would have been different if we had redeclared d as var d = "e" in which case the next console.log would have printed string.
